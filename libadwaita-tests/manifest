# This library relies on additional libraries that aren't currently packaged and
# need to be installed through the system package manager.
#
# For now, only Fedora is supported, as the required libraries must meet minimum
# version requirements, and Fedora is the only distribution that consistently
# provides the necessary up-to-date versions.
